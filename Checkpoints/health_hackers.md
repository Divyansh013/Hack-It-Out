## Idea
Our team, namely health_hackers, chose to solve the problems faced by the pharma companies in India. As of now, Indian pharmaceutical industry is plagued with vices like production and selling of fake medicines, coupled with overinflated medicine prices. To tackle the same, we employed advanced technological means to ensure legitimacy of the medicines on sale and an algorithm to track and record the supply chain of the said medicines in real-time.
The various features offered by the project are as follows:
1] Authentication of the particular medicines using specific hashes for the same.
2] Back tracing the origins of faulty medicines.
3] Employing a cryptographic hash function to encrypt the medicineID.
4] Making an user-friendly interface for users to find information of given medicine.
5] Building a decentralised, tamper-proof database to record the relevant medicinal data.
6] For the final user, he can just scan the qrcode with any scanner and decide whether to buy the medicine or not.

The solution is subject to change and is actively under the development phase.

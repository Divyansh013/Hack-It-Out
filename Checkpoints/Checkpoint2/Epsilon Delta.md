## A brief about work done till now
We are building a AI powered Health Record Management System, which also allowes real time communication to resolve doubts and improve patient outcomes. So far we are almost done
with the frontend , only 2-3 pages are remaining. Authentication has been implemented via google login, into different patient and doctor routes.<br>

Getting initial patient info has been implemented with the help of our gpt3.5turbo chatbot , only some ui changes remain. We have used OpenAI's api to implement a personalized way for to get information specific to that particular user
with the help of gpt3.5turbo's specific prompt engineered model. The model provides a very personalised and user friendly way for the user to
enter information , even providing the ability to change input language, and asking condition specific questions, as well as detecting absurd responses.
After we get the information, the model itself generates a JSON file consisting of various user insights 
like allergies , overview , information about the users age , sex , height , weight etc. We use this information to display on the health history dashboard to display
to the doctor as well.<br>

We have also made some progress with user appointments and its payment gateway<br>

<strong>What is left<Strong>
  We need to accept user inputs and froms in the health history , prescriptions and test reports page and display them for the doctor to see , as well as generate particulalr insights for the 
  user in different pages via the use of the models we have already prompt engineered. We will also use the same model to notify the doctor in case a medicine is causing improper reactions
  for the patient, as well as alert him in case a test report has vastly abnormal values, correlating this information with previous user inputs we got from out personalized chatbot.

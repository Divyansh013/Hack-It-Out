## A brief about work done till now
So, I'm currently doing the hybrid workplan part, and I'm gonna explain it to you in two parts in which the first part is what I've done till now and the latter one  contains the part I'm focussing to complete.

Work till now:
I've made a dashboard for the employees and also for the admin, where the employees will see the listed project which the admin will create on which they can select or click if collaboration is open due to which the admin will know this specific employee is asking for permission to collab on which the admin can view the employee details such  as whether the employee is overburden with work or in mental depression or is low in performance on which he will make the decision of accepting the request.
In short, all the details of the employees will be presented to the admin as well as the projects'data such as project time duration, project induction time and the employees who are currently working on the project.
A small scale virtual reality is also been created which will show the small environment of the office, or as per the request is from the employees (p.s. currently been decided by me).

Future plans:
For Mental depression check either I can use the type of chat the employee is been writing but that would be very incomplete to judge as they would be chatting in a formal words.
So I would be judging them on the basis of their performance because of which I can tell whether is the employee is low in performance or in mental depression based on his performance on projects.
Data has to added onto the database which I have created so that I would be able so content into the frontend.

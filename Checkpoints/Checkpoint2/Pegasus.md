## A brief about work done till now
Moving on the project we have now created a HomePage which can direct users/students to register/login. Along with that we also have created an mobile application which can use the camera for scanning a QR to capture/monitor students in/out that  will update our backend sheets.

As we are making a serverless application, the main task ahend is calling the respective apis from our frontend and get the appropriate data. Most of the frontend part is over we are working on making the application more and more functional.
### The Apis created are

#### Gate Pass Out
[Gate Pass Out API](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyiFBUagORWGI6QHQAJ-jE-ao8CqXRMFZ8Qp6x2CYPqzF1K8XQzo-ir6M0vDgrks-jK2g/exec?roll=roll_of_the_student&purpose=purpose)

This will add the purpose, time in the register and also adds the purpose in the location column in the Form Responses 1


#### Gate Pass In
[Gate Pass In API](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxNHuZv1OksEsIF-L5XHYxLIL2oE23t-FmbpTnmAlQOlpgNNzAhgLqFzoR-lfjZldk/exec?roll=roll_of_the_student)

This will empty the location column for the particular student

Very important to check whether all the parameters are empty or not and then only run the API Request

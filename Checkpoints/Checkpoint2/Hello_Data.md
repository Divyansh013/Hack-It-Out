Title :  
Drug Expiration Date Clustering to Reduce Waste of Drugs
Objective :
Health Care Cost
The objective of this project is to cluster drugs based on their expiration dates and develop a tool that enables healthcare professionals to quickly identify drugs that are close to their expiration date, reducing waste and improving patient safety.

A brief about work done till now :
At first we created dataset by extracting from pharmaceuticals pages and then we imported required libraries needed for the model then we preprocess the data and after that done feature engineering on that and after that applied KMeans algorithm and visualize the data after clustering and at last used silhouette_score to match the accuracy of thr model made till now.

Conclusion :

The project on drug expiration date clustering will improve the drug inventory management by reducing waste. By applying clustering techniques to the expiration dates data, the project has enabled the identification of drugs that are close to their expiration date and the development of appropriate actions to prevent their waste. This has led to more efficient use of resources, cost savings, and better patient safety.

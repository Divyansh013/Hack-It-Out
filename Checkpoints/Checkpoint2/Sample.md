## A brief about work done till now
There are many edtech applications that can benefit underprivileged students like-

1. Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a free online learning platform that offers video lessons and practice exercises in a variety of subjects, including math, science, and humanities. It is a great resource for students who may not have access to traditional classroom instruction or who need additional support in their studies.

2. Scratch: Scratch is a free coding platform that allows students to create interactive stories, games, and animations. It is a great way to introduce underprivileged students to the world of coding and technology.

3. Google Classroom: Google Classroom is a free platform that allows teachers to create and manage online classrooms. Students can access assignments, submit work, and communicate with their teachers and classmates from anywhere with an internet connection.

4. Quizlet: Quizlet is a free study tool that allows students to create digital flashcards and quizzes to help them prepare for exams. It is a great way to help underprivileged students review and retain information.

These are just a few examples of edtech applications that can benefit underprivileged students. It's important to consider the specific needs and challenges faced by these students when selecting and implementing these tools.

As these things are getting more and more randomised on the internet, good free sources are getting harder and harder to find for the students to study.
So we are making this platform to give them the best free sources which are available on web and they can get the best from our end and by getting accessed to quality education best minds can serve this nation with thier own free will.

THANKYOU!!

## A brief about work done till now

Features to added in our latest version (18/03/2023 10:00 PM):

1) Adaptive Learning - Creating a more Student-to-Student oriented Network with a lower Involovment of Mentors to help the Students By gaining And Sharing The Knowledge of each Other.
For this , we made a 'Create Hacks - Solve Hack' feature that makes a common quiz for a community of students with input from the students and the solver also being the students in a timed environment .

2) A common Community Forum ( called - 'Your TalkDesk' ) , which lists all the important bulletin  from the mentors and posts in the same server (forum ) and and it will also contain filtered contents (using npm bad-words module of Node.js) 

3) Well timed pop-ups that grab  the students' momentarily view and connect them to lots of best news sites of their favourite topic

4) Gamification of Resources - We are transforming even the most boring concepts in an interactive content using a podcasts , documentary databases updated / retrieved by the students as well as mentors.(CRUD approach)

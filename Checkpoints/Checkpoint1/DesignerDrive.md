## Idea
Problem:
From ancient to Mughal and then to the modern age, India has witnessed diverse creative
skill culture among the public. These skills are passed down by ancestors to the
grandchildren.
But today’s scenario has been totally different for those who have profound skills and
creativity. They struggle hard to earn a bare minimum to feed their family. Neither of their
descendants wants to learn these skills. And guess what their talent got dead as their life.
These are just one case it takes another case of domestic violence victims living their life as
hell. They don’t have the freedom to follow their passion. These women have really great
creative skills which got confined to their dining table.
According to many studies students really want to learn these creative skills and not just the
creative skills but skills related to their very own field, like skills related to mechanical
engineering, Civil engineering.
Solution:
We gonna develop a website for the teacher(professionals that include mechanical
engineering industrial experts who want to teach, creative persons or artists, or cottage
industry owners) and the students who want to learn beyond their age barrier.
1. It’s very hard to get the time for industry experts to teach and it’s very difficult for the
cottage industry to structure the course due to a lack of knowledge of technology. We
gonna help them to design and structure courses they just have to teach that thing if they
want to do so.
2. We gonna cover all skills that can step up the living standard by any means be it
photography, graphic design, handicraft, art basic welding course for mechanical
engineering, etc.
3. On this website, anyone can learn any skill even if he/she is a teacher on this platform
which means it’s both ways you can be a teacher and a student too.
4. Students can attend live sessions or can learn from a recorded lecture.
5. The mentorship program and doubt-solving sessions.
6. There will be a certification of the courses to needed courses.
7. This website will include basic education for the women, illiterate people, and kids who
want to learn. We gonna show them these courses in groups. It will be very easy to
imagine for them.
8. There will fee-based certification process.
9. And fee wavier based on their performance for those who can’t afford the certification
fees.

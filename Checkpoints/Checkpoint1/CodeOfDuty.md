## Idea

Problem Statement - **Student learning**   
* In this section we are mainly focused on the *doubt solving* part  
  
**OUR SOLUTION**   
We are evaluating the students according to certain criterias and then categorising them in three categories :  
* weak  
* medium  
* good  
  
For these WE  are evaluating students on the basis of these criteria :  
  
1.Their *CLASS ATTENTIVITY*  
  Here we are giving them previous class questions in between the class to check whether the student is attending the class or not  
  
2.*RANGE OF TIME* - Duration for which he/she *attended the class*  
  
3.*A SMALL MCQ*  test at the end of the class  
  
On the basis of these a chart is prepared of students, then a schedule will be generated according to the categories of students.

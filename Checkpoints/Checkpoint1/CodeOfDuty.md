## Idea
Student learning 
in this section we are mainly focused on the doubt solving part 

OUR SOLUTION
we are evaluating the students according to certain criterias and then categorising them in three categories
1.weak 
2.medium
3.good
for these WE  are evaluating students on the basis of these criteria 
1.their class attentivity 
  here we are giving them previous class questions in between the class to check whether the student is attending the class or not

2.Range of time - he/she attended the class

3.A small MCQ  test at the end of the class

On the basis of these a chart is prepared of students, then a schedule will be generated according to the categories of students.

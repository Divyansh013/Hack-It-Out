## Idea

We have created a Collaborative Web App - Synergy, which aims to help people working as a team in hybrid workspace to collaborate in a better way!

A user(project leader) can create a team, that will generate a unique code and users will be able to join a particular team by filling in the unique team code.

The project leader can assign tasks to the members and track progress

The team members will be able to view the tasks assigned to them as well as other members and mark the completed tasks.

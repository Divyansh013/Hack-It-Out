## Idea
As a httpsUI designer for an e-learning website targeted towards individuals experiencing poverty, disability, or geographic isolation, here are some features you should consider incorporating into your design:

Accessibility features: The website should be designed to be accessible to individuals with disabilities. This means including features such as alt text for images, closed captioning for videos, and adjustable font sizes.

Simple navigation: The website should be easy to navigate, with clear and intuitive menus and navigation bars. This will help individuals who may not be familiar with online learning platforms to easily find the content they need.

Mobile-friendly design: Many individuals experiencing poverty or geographic isolation may not have access to desktop computers or laptops. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the website is mobile-friendly, with responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

Multiple language support: To reach a wider audience, the website should be designed to support multiple languages. This can be especially important for individuals who are not native speakers of the language of instruction.

Low bandwidth support: In areas with limited internet connectivity, it is important to design the website with low bandwidth in mind. This can include optimizing images and videos to reduce file size, and using compressed audio files.

Gamification: Gamification can be a powerful tool for engaging learners and keeping them motivated. By incorporating features such as badges, leaderboards, and progress tracking, you can make the learning experience more engaging and enjoyable.

Interactive elements: To make the learning experience more interactive, consider incorporating features such as quizzes, interactive videos, and discussion forums. This can help to create a sense of community among learners, and encourage engagement and participation.

By incorporating these features into your UI design, you can create an e-learning website that is accessible, engaging, and effective for individuals experiencing poverty, disability, or geographic isolation.

## Idea
Patients often have to visit multiple doctors, clinics or hospitals for their treatment, which can lead to a fragmented and incomplete medical records. This can be a major issue for patients as well as the healthcare providers, especially those with chronic conditions, as it can lead to ineffective or even dangerous treatments due to lack of information about previous diagnoses, medications, and procedures. In cases of emergencies or sudden health issues,  it is challenging to provide relevant medical information to healthcare providers in a timely and accurate manner.Moreover, patients may face difficulties in tracking their medication schedules, keeping up with follow-up appointments, and accessing their medical records when needed. 

Our Idea, MedifyMe, is a web application that aims to simplify healthcare management for both patients and doctors aims to solve these issues by providing a centralized platform for patients to store and manage their medical records, including doctor's notes, prescriptions, test results, and appointment history utilizing OCR and generative AI to ease the record management process for both patients and the healthcare provider. This allows for a more complete and accurate medical record, which can facilitate better treatment outcomes and reduce the risk of medical errors. The platform helps patients keep track of their medical history, prescriptions, appointments, and test reports. It also provides reminders for medications and tests, and allows patients to give feedback about their experiences with different treatments. The tool is segmented into various tabs to ease different parts of the healthcare process. 
<ol>
<li>Health History: Patients can view and update their complete health history in one place, including past appointments, symptoms, and comments from past doctors. This can get the current healthcare provider a good idea about the past treatments as well as maintain a timeline for proper management of the condition.</li>

<li>Prescription and Medication Management: MedifyMe allows patients to keep track of their medications, allergies, and past prescriptions. The doctor can list usage conditions for the medications which can be easily managed with the help of OpenAI's API using NLP on the platfom itself. It will also provides reminders for medications and allows patients to provide feedback on their experiences with different medications, allowing the doctor to act accordingly. </li>

<li>Test Reports: Patients can easily upload and view their test reports on the platform. The system uses OCR technology to extract important information from the reports and presents it to patients in an easy-to-understand format. Doctors can schedule required tests here</li>

<li>Appointments: Patients can view their appointments, schedule new appointments, and receive reminders about upcoming appointments. The platform also allows patients to pay for appointments and tests using integrated payment systems.</li>

MedifyMe provides an easy and secure communication channel for patients and doctors to exchange messages and medical information. Patients can ask questions, get advice, and share updates with their doctors in a timely and convenient manner. Payments for various appointments and tests can be made on the platform itself, reducing the hassle.

## Idea

=> we specialize in creating market-driven products that meet the needs of our target audience. In this case, our target audience and rather we should say our players are the  students who are passionate about their academic portfolios but don't have access to educational content, compensated by those who are interested in learning new things. 

Our product's theoretical features to incorporate - 

1. Cascading of knowledge
2. Promotion of accessibility to Content
3. Addressing the fed-Up Students with the Old Educational System
4. Incorporation of Features in the Schooling System
5. Decentralizing the System and Making it More Flexible (like YouTube)
6. Students for Students Idea (like NPTEL but for students)
7. Content-Free, Open Accessibility to Main Educational Content (unlike coaching mafias like Unacademy, which charges premium)

While each of these features has the potential to create a successful product, we have yet to find a platform that incorporates all of them, that's our trial.

Following are some of the features:

1. Gamifying Education
2. Activity Corner
3. Pop-Ups
4. Documentation of our application

## Idea
Following are the set of feature we want to include into our webapp/ digital platform so that the employees should feel more inclusive into the works and the employers can effectively monitor them based on their performance to increase the productivity.

1. Developing a digital platform that promotes in-person interactions and experiences in the hybrid workplace: This platform would feature virtual events that allow employees to network and collaborate with colleagues from different departments and locations. It would also include features such as virtual coffee breaks or lunch meetings to help employees feel more connected to their colleagues.

2. Creating an employee engagement platform that facilitates cross-functional collaboration and creates a sense of belonging in the hybrid workplace: This platform would help employees connect with each other and work on projects together. It could include features such as gamification and rewards to encourage participation and engagement(adding star points for each collaboration).

3. Developing productivity tools that help employees carry out tedious tasks in the hybrid workplace: These tools would include automation software that takes care of repetitive tasks, freeing up time for employees to focus on more important tasks. They would also include time management tools that help employees prioritize their work and manage their workload effectively.

4. Improving existing collaboration tools like Slack, Teams, and Zoom for better internal communications: This would involve developing plugins or add-ons that enhance the functionality of these tools, such as the ability to share files more easily or to collaborate on documents in real-time.

5. Creating a digital wellness platform that promotes mental health and overall well-being in the hybrid workplace: This platform would include resources such as guided meditations, mental health assessments, and stress management tools. It would also include features that encourage employees to take breaks, get up and move around, and practice self-care.

6. Providing insights into what is working and what is not in the hybrid work setup: This would involve developing analytics tools that track employee engagement and productivity, as well as employee feedback mechanisms that allow workers to share their experiences and suggestions for improvement.

All above mentioned points will help to establish well-performing Hybrid Model which would be beneficiary for both employee and the employer.

## Idea
There is a common abstacle that every stuudent face in thier study like speacially girls students that they are not allowed to pursue higher education due to various reasons. The reasons can be parents community conception of parents about carrier oppurtunity in some courses and fields like B.ED,commerce,music,dance,youtuber. Due to which every year many student get into their desired field or education. This problem is very common rular areas.
let understand this clearly by this example. Ex- Sita want to go delhi from her village for higher education but her aprents not allowed her for resulting she can't study further after 10th.She tried to convince her parents but failed because her parents asked to their relatives, neighbour who don't have any idea about the biotechnic engineer and importance of girls education. If sita parents can able to interact with students,teachers or alumini of biotech then she can study furthur.
Ex2- Ram wants ot make carrer in the online paltforms like youtube as he is passionate about creating contents,blogs,etc but he didn't allow him to create carrer in online platform so he changed his field now he is studying B.Tech. Ram problem couls be solved by his parents and couls able to interact with the people belonging to the online carrer background and his parents will easily convince but that issue happened because ram parent's take avice from their relatives ,neighbourhood who don't have any idea about even field.
In above example we conclude that-1. Many parents didnot understand their field. 2. parents take advice from their relative,neighbours instaead of right people resulting shifting or carrer. 
we have also observed people like- 1. student can't able to trust on him/her regarding thierself in carrer which they have choosen their confidence level decrease as they dod't get proper mentor,guider ,suggestion from right person belonging from that carrer background.
Our idea based on the solution of above problems-
1. our website provide a platform where student can get proper guidance, suggestions about thier carrer with that they have choosen from the students teacher alumini belonging from choosen caarrer.
2. our website allowed to take advice and suggetsions for parents from right people instaed of asking to relatives or neighbours about the carrer choosen by their son/daughter.

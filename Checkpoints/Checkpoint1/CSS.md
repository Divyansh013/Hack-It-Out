## Idea
Following are the set of feature we want to include into our webapp/ digital platform so that the employees should feel more inclusive into the works and the employers can effectively monitor them based on their performance to increase the productivity.

1. Developing a digital platform that promotes in-person interactions and experiences in the hybrid workplace

2. Creating an employee engagement platform that facilitates cross-functional collaboration and creates a sense of belonging in the hybrid workplace

3. Developing productivity tools that help employees carry out tedious tasks in the hybrid workplace

4. Improving existing collaboration tools like Slack, Teams, and Zoom for better internal communications

5. Creating a digital wellness platform that promotes mental health and overall well-being in the hybrid workplace

6. Providing insights into what is working and what is not in the hybrid work setup

Dashboard has been made in which admin and general employee can login into it and according to their control power they can execute their respective functions.
An admin an add projects into the dashboard which employee will see in their dashboard and they can choose the projects to work upon onto them.
A mental check also will be run along with the performance meter to analyse the employee.

All above mentioned points will help to establish well-performing Hybrid Model which would be beneficiary for both employee and the employer.

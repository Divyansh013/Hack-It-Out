<h2>Idea</h2>

<h1> Designing and developing an e-learning platform 
that will help the students of rural areas to 
overcome their challenges that they face to get 
themselves educated. This platform will provide 
very simple and affordable quality education 
online as well as our offline instructors will interact 
with the guardians. Organizing competitions will 
help to initiate the competitive spirit and help to 
build their knowledge. </h1>

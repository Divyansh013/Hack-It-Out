# Idea
Our theme is Web3. 
During elections a lot of corruption incidents take place so we're developing a platform where users can report corruption and other petty crimes in their localities with images and other proofs. This data would be securely stored on a decentralised blockchain and can be viewed by other people in the same locality. This would help in reporting of crimes and ensuring a sense of security and transparency amongst the people.

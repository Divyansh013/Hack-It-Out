IDEA:
-CHECKPOINT 3
-all routes set to register and login Students and Professors .
-routes to render requisite ejs views(in addition to views themselves) added to create new classes under a professor ,to add Tasks to a class and to enable students 
to get enrolled in created classes using a Unique Class Key .
-Classes are instanced out of a model class that necessarily includes "name" , "key"(system generated) of the class .
-Classes are modelled to contain references to Student Class instances.
-Student instances correspond to indidual docs that are made for individual registered students.
Each Student-doc is made to contain the refernces to following(besides "name","roll","password"):
   -references to classes that the particular students    
   -map of string(task id) to evaluation grade for the tasks assigned to that student across all classes.

-requisite routes for above functionalities have been set,doc models modified and used/referenced where doc field data was bidirectionally required to be accessed .
